@Description: First Completely Painted Row or Column
"""
# You are given a 0-indexed integer array `arr`, and an `m x n` integer matrix mat. `arr` and `mat` both contain all the integers in the range [1, m * n].

# Go through each index i in arr starting from index 0 and paint the cell in mat containing the integer arr[i].
# Return the smallest index i at which either a row or a column will be completely painted in mat.
